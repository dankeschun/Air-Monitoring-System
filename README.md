A Dual-Parameter Approach to Environmental Air Monitoring
Description
This project presents an innovative Internet of Things (IoT) air quality monitoring system. Designed for precision and reliability, it utilizes advanced sensors like the MQ135 for air pollutants (CO2, NH3, benzene) and the DHT11 for temperature and humidity. The device provides real-time monitoring and logs environmental data, making it effective for assessing air quality, especially in regions with complex pollution challenges. The data is visualized on an OLED display, allowing immediate intervention to enhance public health and environmental sustainability.

Features
- Dual-Parameter Monitoring: Measures both air quality (pollutants) and environmental parameters (temperature, humidity).
- Real-Time Data Logging: Captures and displays data instantaneously through IoT integration.
- Wireless Connectivity: Enables remote monitoring and data access via cloud platforms.
- User-Friendly Interface: An OLED screen provides live feedback, and mobile/web integration increases accessibility.

Hardware Components
- Arduino Nano: The microcontroller at the heart of the system.
- DHT11 Sensor: Monitors temperature and humidity levels.
- MQ135 Sensor: Detects harmful gases like ammonia, CO2, and other volatile organic compounds.
- OLED Display: Provides visual output of the monitored data.

Installation and Usage
- Hardware Setup: Assemble the Arduino Nano, MQ135, DHT11, and OLED screen as per the schematic diagram (provided in the documentation).
- Software Configuration: Upload the code to the Arduino Nano. Ensure libraries for the OLED display and sensors are installed.
- Data Access: The device can transmit data to an IoT platform, allowing remote access and monitoring.

Results and Insights
The system effectively captured variations in air quality, temperature, and humidity over a test period, showing correlations between these parameters. It demonstrated reliability in detecting pollutants and environmental changes, proving its value for public health monitoring and air quality management.

Future Developments
Integration of additional sensors for broader pollutant detection (e.g., SO2, VOCs).
Enhanced data analytics with machine learning for predictive insights.
Solar-powered options for improved sustainability and remote deployment.
